    <div class="para"><p>As soon as I got off my long flight, I knew where I want to go. I visit the <em>"Bruj Khalifa"</em> and make sure I book myself a room. The next day I visited the famous Dubai Mall, it was one of the craziest experiences ever. I couldn't even explore the whole thing because it was so big. I ended up visting <strong>the aquariam</strong> and also some designer outlets.<br>
   since I only had one more day there I made sure that my family and I rented out luxurious cars to drive in. I got the Rolls Royce. We went to the Dubai beaches and some other sandy areas in our free time. Dubai's water are nice and blue. </p></div>
